Chai Assertions are for non-webdriverIO assertions.

we have our browser realated assertions handled by WebdriverIO, but Chai handles assertions for two strings, or check that a value is a boolean, etc.

WebdriverIO handles web related assetions like the following:

    toBeDisplayed
    toExist
    toBePresent
    toBeClickable
    toBeChecked,
    etc.

Chai helps with assertions outside the web related actions like string vs string.
