Chai Assertions are for non-webdriverIO assertions.

we have our browser realated assertions handled by WebdriverIO, but Chai handles assertions for two strings, or check that a value is a boolean, etc.

WebdriverIO handles web related assetions like the following:

    toBeDisplayed
    toExist
    toBePresent
    toBeClickable
    toBeChecked,
    etc.

Chai helps with assertions outside the web related actions like string vs string.

TO USE IN TESTS

make a const variable and make it equal to the require('chai).expect value.

const expectchai = require('chai').expect

This is so we can differentiate between webdriverIO expect, called 'expect', and chai's expect library, which has the same name.

We are aliasing the chai library.


CHAI LIBRARY 

.equal vs .eql methods.

equal: Asserts that a target is strictly (===) equal to the given value.
eql: Asserts that the target is deeply equal to the value.

Strictly equal means you are comparing exactly the same object to itself. It's checking whether some instance of an object is the same instance as the calling object.

Deeply equal eql means that the two objects can be different, but every proparty between them has the same value.
